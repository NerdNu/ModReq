ModReq
======
ModReq (**Mod**erator **Req**uest) is a help ticket management system for Minecraft.  Players make requests with the `/modreq` command, which saves the coordinates of the requesting player and the request text.  Staff can see all requests in a work queue and can select which request to handle next.

Requests can be in one of three states:
 * OPEN - The request has been made but is not yet being handled by staff.
 * CLAIMED - A staff member has started work on the request. A request can only be claimed by a single staff member at a time.
 * CLOSED - The request was completed (or denied).  Players can also close their own requests, even if not a staff member.

ModReq supports two tiers of staff permissions: Moderator and Admin.  Admins are assumed to have some superset of Moderator permissions.  By default, new requests are visible to all staff members (Moderators and Admins).  However, requests can be marked as requiring an Admin to handle them using the `/elevate` command.  Elevated requests are hidden from Moderators unless using extra options to the `/check` command.


Commands
--------
Note: In the discussion that follows, `#` signifies a number.

Many commands support the use of `-`, instead of a request ID number, to signify the request that was most recently claimed by the staff member.

`/modreq <request>`
 * Make a request.  The coordinates of the player making the request are saved by the command.

`/check #`
 * Retrieve a full description of the request with the specified number.

`/check -`
 * Retrieve a full description of the most recently claimed request.

`/check [--page # | -p # | p:#] [--admin | -a] [--search term | -s term]`
 * List all open requests matching specified criteria.  Requests are grouped into pages of (by default) 5 requests and `/check` only shows one page of requests at a time.
 * `/check` on its own lists all requests visible to the player. Non-staff players will only see open requests that they have made themselves. Moderators will see requests by other players, but not those that have been elevated. Admins will see all requests.
 * `--page`, `-p` or `p:` select a different page to show.  Pages are numbered starting at 1.
 * `--admin` or `-a` allow Admin requests to be visible to Moderators. Without one of these options, moderators will only see open requests that have not been elevated.
 * `--search` or `-s` allow a search term to be specified. Only requests whose text include the term will be listed.

`/tp-id #` or `/tpid #`
 * A staff-only command to teleport to the location of a request.
 * `/tp-id -` or `/tpi -` will teleport to the location of the most recently claimed request.

`/claim #`
 * A staff-only command to claim exclusive access to a request.
 * The request is moved to the CLAIMED state and associated with a staff member.

`/unclaim #`
 * Remove your claim on a request that you have previously claimed with `/claim`.
 * The request is returned to the OPEN state and not associated with any staff member.
 * `/unclaim -` will unclaim the most recently claimed request.

`/done # [message]`
 * Mark a request as completed, optionally specifying a message that will be sent to the requesting player.
 * The request is moved to the CLOSED state.
 * `/done - [message]` closes the most recently claimed request, with an optional close message.

`/reopen #`
 * Reopen a closed request.
 * The request changes to the OPEN state.
 * `/reopen -` attempts to reopen the most recently claimed request.

`/elevate #`
 * Mark the request as requiring handling by an Admin.
 * If the request is currently claimed by the staff member running the command, it is unclaimed.
 * `/elevate -` attempts to unclaim and elevate the most recently claimed request.

`/tpinfo #` or `/tpi #`
 * A staff command to teleport to and check the details of a request without claiming it.
 * This command is shorthand for `/tp-id #` followed by `/check #`.
 * `/tpinfo -` or `/tpi -` will teleport to and check the most recently claimed request.

`/tpc #`
 * A staff command that tries to claim a request and, _only if successful_, teleport to and check the details of the request.
 * An error message will be shown if another staff member has already claimed or closed the request.
 * If you have already claimed the request, the command acts as `/tpi`.
 * The command executes `/claim #`, and if successful `/tpi #`.

`/mr-note add # text`
 * A staff command to add a note to a request designated by its ID number.
 * The first note attached to a request is numbered 1.  Subsequent notes attached to the same request have progressively higher numbers.
 * Notes are only visible to staff.
 * `/mr-note add - text` adds a note to the most recently claimed request.

`/mr-note remove # #`
 * A staff command to remove a note from a request; the first number is the request ID and the second number is the note ID, which starts at 1.
 * Notes are only visible to staff.
 * `/mr-note remove - #` removes a note from the most recently claimed request.

`/mr-reset`
 * A staff command to reset the database.

`/mr-upgrade`
 * A staff command to upgrade the database.
